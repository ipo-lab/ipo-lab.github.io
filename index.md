## About

We are a group of scientists and engineers studying the impact that machine learning predictions have on downstream decision-making systems. We are interested in doing both basic-science and applied research across a variety disciplines including: data science, optimization, machine learning, financial engineering, and more.  We believe in an open and collaborative research environment. If you are interested in getting involved or learning more then please reach out.
